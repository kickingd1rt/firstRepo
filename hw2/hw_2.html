            <p>So far my college experience has been one I was <i>not</i> expecting. While in high school, I was taking college classes 
                here at City Tech towards a Computer Science degree.<br> I even did an internship at IBM. However, the first semester during 
                Covid was rough and it solidified my feelings towards coding and Computer Science adjacent jobs.<br> So I ended up not finishing 
                the degree and taking a one year break to relax and figure out what I wanted to do.</p> 
            
            <p>After that I decided to come back to school and pursue graphic design as I've been doing it as a hobby during 
                high school and into early college. So far, the design work<br> I've done in class is nont excatly what I want to 
                "learn" but I am now going into my second year where classes have become a bit more challenging. </p>
